# Overview:
University coursework project for 'Robotics and Autonomous Systems' module.
The project was split into exercises 1 and 2, both involving the control of a differential robot. The robot was simulated in a CoppeliaSim enviroment. 

## Exercise 1:
The ROS node for exercise 1 is contained within 'rosPub.py'
rosPub.py is the navigation program for a differential robot, allowing it to autonomously navigate a maze (CoppeliaSim enviroment found in 'mazeWithLine') until it crosses a black finish line. 


## Exercise2: 
For exercise 2, CNN_arrows_recognition_real-time_ros_template.py uses the model '.modelV1.h5' trained on images of handwitten arrows(CNN_arrows_recognition_real-time_ros_template.py) to control the direction of the differential robot depending on the direction of arrows in a dataset of images.
